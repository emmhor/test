    Okay guys, welcome to video number two of phase two. Um, and this is pretty much where we're going to dive into structural ranges. Um, what a structural point is, the types of structural points, right? And I'm also gonna introduce, unwillingness and showing its hand, um, probably towards the later side of the video.
    
    Okay, so a structural range. A structural range is the relation of distance and previous structural points to determine an isolated range of potential continuation. Okay? What does that mean? That means highs that create lows are your ranges to play inside of, depending on, you know, the level of structure you're dealing with.
    
    And the reason why I say that is because the lower you go in timeframes or in structural levels, Right. Pretty much anything below major intra day, the security of those structural ranges is not as likely as the security of a, you know, a swing structural range, a position, structural range. Right? But position, structural range can be weird because, um, if you can identify specific, um, structural range breaks on, let's say your swing and your major intraday.
    
    Right, that can completely invalidate a, an overall position, structural range. Right? And pretty much we've seen that in eu. Um, and we'll get to that. I'll show you guys that before, um, before the video ends. Um, but we can first start off with essentially showing you what a structural range is. Um, still a structural range, as you can see in this image, right?
    
    Is it high that creates a low or a low that creates a high. Right, and it must take out a previous low or high. Um, so as you can see here, right, we have our high, that created a low, that took out a previous structure point, giving us that that direction that it wants to take. This is showing a 10. That's essentially what that means.
    
    Okay? So right as we go through there, any pullback naturally has to continue bearish. Um, if that is the essential hand that it's showing, right? So, right. You see this, this pullback extremely deep here, did not break structure right? And this is the leg that create, I mean, this is the high that created the next low that took out the previous structural point.
    
    Okay? So the reason why I'm not using this low or this high is because this low. It's still before this high. So this may be a structural range, just not on the structural level. Okay. So right, this is where I can also introduce, um, the two types of structural points. So you have a point of liquidity. Um, a point of potential liquidity, let me put it at that.
    
    And a solidified structure point. A solidified structure point is a higher, is a high that actually creates a new high or a low that actually creates a new low. I mean a high that creates a new low and a low that creates a new high. I'm sorry. Um, because that signifies trend continuation, right? Whereas a point of potential liquidity, right?
    
    Let's say here right, is a low that does not create a new high, right, or a high that does not create a new low. Right. So although this did not immediately create a new low, this would now be referenced as a potential point of liquidity. The reason why I say potential is because liquidity right, is something we're gonna cover down in, through in the course.
    
    It does not signify your bias, but it gives you a quote unquote hunch. Um, so right, it doesn't make sense. Right. Even though this high did not create this new low, I cannot assume this is gonna go bullish until the structure point or any type of previous structure point is actually taken out, right? So right.
    
    As you can see, our initial high to low, this is now the range that we're playing in. We get our pullback, right? And although we fail to create a new low, right, we start to retrace, as you see, start to slow down. And we actually peak here. So as soon as we see this come down, right, this is not gonna be a, um, a structural point on this specific timeframe level or this specific structural level, right?
    
    Because this load did not create a new high and it doesn't support the previous structural range, right? So all of this didn't immediately create a new low. It still supports. The overall structural range. So naturally, if even if it takes longer than one drive, right, I'm still gonna be confident in the bias until a previous high breaks, right?
    
    Which is the initial rule from structure from the original course. Right. So I'm gonna pretty much dive into here into a couple of examples, right? And so another way to, I guess, put structural ranges is your structural range is the range between your two recent solidified structure points. Right. Um, so, right, because these two are solidified points because this high created a new low on this timeframe, a significant low here, right?
    
    That is why that is my structural range on this structural level, right? So as we dive into more examples, right, this is now a, a daily timeframe, which would be more so considered your swing timeframes. Right. So as you can see, right, none of this here matters. This is super messy, right? And until I see this, right, our high, that creates a low, takes out previous low, right?
    
    We now have a pullback, a high that creates a low, which is here, right? And then a high. A high that creates a new low that took out these previous lows here, right? So, alright, this is a very clear way. To eliminate a lot of noise based off the structural level that you're looking into, right? So the, the key reference points, right, is always, for example, in a down trend, your key reference point is gonna be the low that you make, the lows that you make, correct?
    
    And in an uptrend, right, the, so the most important points to me would be, you know, that high in a, in a, in a, I'm sorry, in a bullish trend. Um, so. Right. That kind of falls back to, to kind of, um, the old structural rules that I used, um, or that I gave you guys, I still use them, right? For example, here in this down trend, right, on the, if we don't break any type of high, any type of significant high right, which is a significant high, would be referenced to a structural range high, right?
    
    Then we will naturally continue creating new lows, right? So I hope that makes sense. Um, but as you can see, like I said, this kind of real, like, in my opinion, this really eliminates a lot of noise. Like, for example, it doesn't have you, you know, trying to signify every structural point, right? Unless you're starting to dive into smaller timeframes, right?
    
    So now I'm heading more towards my major entry day, right? So as you can see, we are initially bullish. The meaning our swing is init is still bullish, right? But we're seeing. Right. Structural ranges towards the bare side, right high. That creates a low, that takes out a previous low high that creates a low, that create, that takes out a previous low, right?
    
    And then high, right then, right comes down and we fail to create a new low, and we now see this showing its hand, right? So this orange square here is called unwillingness. This is your unwillingness to continue lower. Right, but the only way for an unwillingness point to be valid is if it now breaks this, right?
    
    So it signifies to me that direction has shifted, right? So, unwillingness break of structure here, because we took out a previous high, right? So not a pullback, although it may break, you know, these, um, smaller structural ranges inside of our. Inside of this overall range, you always have to reference the overall range, right?
    
    Because let's say for example, if you're looking at this low, this high, create a new high, this low, this high that created a new high, I'm looking at the previous major significant high, and I'm seeing the overall point that took this level of structure out. Okay, so. From here, even though you have a breaker structure here, it still makes all the sense in the world for it to continue higher, even though I wouldn't probably consider this a, a structure break.
    
    Actually, this more as a liquidity grab, and we're gonna cover this, um, towards the end of this phase, right? But I just want you to eliminate a lot of noise with structure and find direction based off of your structural ranges. Okay? So the reason why I, I mainly. Reference these in your, in your swing, in your, um, position and in your major intra day.
    
    Your swing and your major intra day are probably gonna be your two favorite ones. Um, because for the most part, we're all swing intra day traders. I don't really see any scalpers inside of our cv. Um, so because those two are, they pretty much fall in line with the types of traders that we are. I see those as being the most significant to give us an overall bias.
    
    Or, you know, directional bias, however you want to call it. So the reason why I say that too is because once we start diving into, um, the smaller or the lower structural levels, right? I'm gonna show you an example here. It gets a bit messy, okay? So let's say this is a previous low, um, just hypothetically, it may not be real.
    
    Um, but this creates a new low. And then we have a pullback that creates a new low. So this is still. Bearish until we show our hand here, until we show our hand. Once it shows its hand, right, then you wanna look for any type of excuse to then go higher. Why? Because if you just focus on, let's say your minor entry and your scalping timeframes, look at what happens.
    
    Look at how messy this gets. Right? And why is that? Because you need these minor intra day legs to create these major intra day legs. Right. So you need consistent levels of structure to create, you know, that overall movement, right? You need,
    
    right? Something like this, right? Let's say this is your major intra days. This is your minor intra day. You need these bullish structural ranges in your minor intra day timeframes to influence these major intraday moves. So as long as you understand the overall composition of your, uh, major intra day in your swing, finding that direction is gonna be a whole lot simpler.
    
    And if you don't trust me on that, just look into it. Like I said, all of this is subjective. All of this is opinionated based off of my trials and tribulations, so I need you all to focus on essentially making this work for you. That is your biggest focus in this course, making this work for you. There is no such thing as an rcv style.
    
    There is no such thing as an Alfredo model. There is no such thing as anything like that, and that's because I want you to find what works for you. Okay, so pretty much a small recap of this video. Um, a structural range is your relation of distance and previous structure points to determine an isolated range of potential continuation.
    
    In other words, highs that create lows. Lows that create highs so that you have a range to overall plan. And remember that the overall security of those structural ranges will diminish as you lower your, your, your. Structural level. Sorry about that. Right. So analyzing structural points, right there is your point of potential liquidity, right?
    
    Which is essentially a low that does not create a high and a high that does not create a low, right? So pretty much back to this image, right? That is directly tied. The point of potential liquidity is directly tied to unwillingness and to showing its hand. Why? Because even though this high did not create a new low, and we're now starting to see structure breaks inside of here, that now fits the narrative of wanting to take this out.
    
    Okay? So I'm not saying that you should be looking for these initial structure breaks because these are still a minor intraday, um, structure breaks on this overall major intraday. Um, Range. Right? Because we know it can get messy. So what I mean by showing its hand is let it show its hand, right? Break that major entry day structure, and then look for that entry, look for that continuation, because that's what's it.
    
    That's what I mean by being conservative. And that overall just increases your prob probabilities of a favorable outcome. Okay, so, and now a solidified structure point, the final, um, Pretty much vocabulary term, if you want to put it like that. Your final, um, word or, or pretty much phrase is your structural range.
    
    I mean, I'm sorry. It's solidified structure point, which is, you know, an actual structure point that creates that low, a high, that creates that low or a low that creates, that a low that creates the high, right? So you see this unwillingness now becomes a solidified structure point because this is where the reversal happened.
    
    Okay, so it seems like a lot I'd recommend you to, to rewatch this. I'd say two to three times to make it make sense. And if it doesn't, um, feel free to give me any questions, concerns, and we can go from there. But other than that, I'll see you guys in the next video.
